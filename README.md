# 👋 Hi, I'm Dale (`da13m`)
🔐 **Microsoft Security Architect** | Azure | M365 | Zero Trust | Automation as Code  

I design and implement secure cloud foundations for Microsoft ecosystems — from **Azure Landing Zones** to **Sentinel detections** — focusing on automation, identity protection, and continuous compliance.

### 🧭 Architecture Focus Areas

| Pillar | Expertise |
|--------|------------|
| **Cloud Security** | Azure Landing Zones, Defender for Cloud, Policy as Code |
| **Identity Protection** | Entra ID, Conditional Access, PIM, Identity Governance |
| **Detection & Response** | Sentinel, KQL, Logic Apps, Automation Playbooks |
| **Endpoint Security** | Intune baselines, Device Compliance, Defender EDR |
| **Governance & Automation** | DevSecOps, PSRule, GitHub Actions, Graph API |

### 🧠 Principles I Build Around
- **Zero Trust by Default** – Identity and device are the new perimeter  
- **Automation First** – No control left manual for long  
- **Defense in Depth** – Multiple overlapping security layers  
- **Continuous Validation** – IaC linting, PSRule, and what-if enforcement  

---

### 🧾 Highlights
✅ Designed and open-sourced a **secure Azure Landing Zone** aligned with Microsoft CAF  
✅ Built **Conditional Access as Code** automation via Graph API  
✅ Created **Sentinel analytic and hunting rules** with MITRE ATT&CK mappings  
✅ Implemented **DevSecOps guardrails** (PSRule + IaC validation) in CI/CD  
✅ Developed **identity automation scripts** for token revocation and PIM auditing
